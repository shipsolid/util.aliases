Jupyter Notebook is a tool that lets you write and run Python code in small chunks (called cells) â€” and see the results immediately, all in your web browser. It's great for learning, experimenting, data science, and even making notes with code.

Think of it like a mix between a code editor and a notebook.

Install it with pip and then you can run it from the terminal "jupyter notebook".

This will open up a web browser.
There you can open these ipynb files, like the one from this directory.
